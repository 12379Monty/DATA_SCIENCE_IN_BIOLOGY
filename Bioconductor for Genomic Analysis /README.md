###Bioconductor Project and R for Genomic Analysis 

Use tools from the Bioconductor project and R program language to:

1. [examine the relationship between bivalent chromatin and CpG](https://github.com/lanttern/DATA_SCIENCE_IN_BIOLOGY/blob/master/Bioconductor%20for%20Genomic%20Analysis%20/Projects/Project1_examine%20the%20relationship%20between%20bivalent%20chromatin%20and%20CpG%20Islands.Rmd)

2. [exam epigenomics Roadmap data](https://github.com/lanttern/DATA_SCIENCE_IN_BIOLOGY/blob/master/Bioconductor%20for%20Genomic%20Analysis%20/Projects/Project2_exam%20epigenomics%20Roadmap%20data.Rmd)

3. [Analyze gene expression dataset](https://github.com/lanttern/DATA_SCIENCE_IN_BIOLOGY/blob/master/Bioconductor%20for%20Genomic%20Analysis%20/Projects/Project3_ExpressionSet.Rmd)

4. [Perform RNA seq analysis](https://github.com/lanttern/DATA_SCIENCE_IN_BIOLOGY/blob/master/Bioconductor%20for%20Genomic%20Analysis%20/Projects/Project4_RNA%20seq%20analysis.Rmd)
