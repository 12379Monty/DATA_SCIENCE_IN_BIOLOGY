# Develop Python Bioinformatics Tools to Analyze DNA Sequence 

In this project, a python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format was developed. The program includes a set of tools for dna sequence analyses (a. check records in file (count_records), b. compute the length of each DNA sequence (check_length), c. identify open read frame in each DNA sequence (orf_identifier), d. identify repeated motif in sequence (repeats_identifier)). To use the tool  sets, please assign the path and file name to the class function. For example: dna_tools = dna_tool_sets ("../data/dna.example.fasta"). Then, call the functions in the class, e.g call function to check length of dna sequence: length = dna_tools.check_length()
